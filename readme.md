### neTTT - Simple Tic Tac Toe over network implementation
ONLY FOR WINDOWS
## Building
```bash
gcc -o server.exe server.c -lws2_32
gcc -o client.exe client.c -lws2_32
```
By default server supports 10 games, two players each.

IDK, I've only build it to learn TCP communication, it's ugly and barely works.
